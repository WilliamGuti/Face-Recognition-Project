This project implements a basic facial recognition system using OpenCV and Python . 👨‍💻✨

It is divided into three main stages:

🎥 Capturing face images from a webcam
🧠 Training a model with the collected data
🔍 Performing real-time face recognition using the trained model
Each step is implemented in a separate script, making the system modular, easy to understand, and perfect as a starting point for more advanced applications like access control, user authentication, or personal identification systems. 🔐🚪
